# buggy game!

For this game I deployed canvas and Javascript. 
  
[play it here!](https://elisavazz.github.io/Bugs/)
  
The process was challenging and very fun at once. Writing it helped me getting familiar with the constructor functions.

A technical challenge I faced was calculating the collisions between the player against the randomly generated objects.
I overcame it through nesting for loops and if statements to check first the position of the object in the orizontal axis and a second instance to find if its vertical position coincided in at least one point to the position of the player.
